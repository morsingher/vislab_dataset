# Multi-View Clustering Algorithm

TODO

- Optimize multi-threading, which is done very naively (use OpenMP?), and parallelize more modules
- Read correctly the color of points
- Integrate relative position between multiple cameras
- Fix weird orientation on y axis and depth ranges
- Blocks can be hierarchically built in order to better distribute points and cameras
- Saving files must be done accounting for scale
