TODO

- Play with parameters
- Visualize features on images
- Neighbors might be in close clusters (improve selection in general)
- Mkdir for each cluster

ELAPSED TIME FOR COMPUTING NEIGHBORS

Batch = 820 filtered poses -> 964 s
Clusters = 40 clusters with 1832 poses -> 140 s (it can be made faster if needed)
